# LinearRegression
Building Linear Regression from scratch.

This script takes in some basic data representing study time and test scores for several students. The data is not real and was generated by GPT-5. 
Given an error function of MSE, compute the gradient by taking the derivative of the MSE equation. Use the gradient to perform gradient descent with a hard-coded learning rate.

Result after 10,000 rounds with a learning rate of 0.001
